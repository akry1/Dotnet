<h3>AlgoImpl</h3>  
Implementation of A* algorithm to solve the 8 puzzle problem. On execution the program asks for user to enter the start node 
and goal node. The program accepts only digits 0-8 and repeated values are not accepted. 
On successful input, the program displays the number of nodes in solution path, 
each state in the path, number of nodes generated and number of nodes expanded.  
  
For detailed report see 'Board Puzzle Report.pdf'  


<h3>AlgoProject1</h3>  
Implementation of Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort and Binary search in C#.
  
For detailed report see 'Sorting Report.pdf' 

<h3>Maintenance Scheduling</h3>

On execution, the program asks the user to Enter 1 to provide input from console or enter any other key to take input from file.  
  

If the user enters any other character except 1 then the program looks for the file “input.txt” in the execution directory, gets the input from the file and displays the output.  
If the user enters 1, then the program asks for number of units, M and then the number of intervals, N. It does not accept N if it is greater than equal to M.  
 
It then accepts the capacities of units, the maximum loads for each interval and number of intervals needed to complete a unit’s maintenance. Each units capacity should be greater than 0. Maximum load and intervals needed should be greater than or equal to zero. Other validations that are done are: maximum load should not exceed the total capacity and intervals needed should not exceed the total number of intervals N.  
After getting the input, the program finds the solution and displays it on console along with the visualization.

<h3>MovieProphecy</h3>
  
A web application build to predict movie ratings based on twitter data developed using .NET, JAVA and Bootstrap.  
The project is developed in Agile fashion from the requirement phase to deployment. The reports for the project are availble in the folder 'MovieProphecy Reports'.

<h3>Project2</h3>
Implementation of N-Queens problem using Hill Climbing and Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
On execution the program asks for user to enter the size of the problem. The program accepts only numbers. 
The program displays solution for Hill Climbing and CSP approaches with the number of random initializations and 
number of state changes.
