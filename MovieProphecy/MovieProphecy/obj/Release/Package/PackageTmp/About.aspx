    <p>User generated content is reshaping the way in which people interact with each other. As more people opt to social media for speaking their minds, ‘opinion mining’ is of great interest to individuals and organizations. A small 140 character Twitter submission (tweet), has a wealth of information which if analysed can provide deep insights into people’s minds.

        <p>
            At MovieProphecy we scrutinize tweets on movies in order to predict their popularity. 
    By harnessing user opinions directly from Twitter, we hope to eliminate extra steps in the aggregate survey field and calibrate user opinions in a more accurate and legitimate way. </p></h4>
